# travel-go-budget
Website built with React that randomly generates an expertly-sourced budget travel idea when main button is clicked. Note: To view project code, please make sure you're viewing from the Master branch.

This project was inspired by a crowd-sourced list of budget travel considerations for Time magazine from a group of inspiring, and very well-traveled folks I grew to be very close to at work.

Overall, I knew I wanted to leverage these good ideas all while creating my own project that used JavaScript and React components, as well as my own HTML/CSS - built from scratch.

As this project grows, I'm hoping to add more functionality, such as:

- fixing the background image so that only the text box updates with the button click
- allowing users to submit their own budget travel destinations
- allowing users to choose a continent and then only receive ideas for that particular continent
