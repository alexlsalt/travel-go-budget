# travel-go-budget

Welcome to Travel-Go-Budget!

I was inspired to build this website after some budget travel destinations were sourced from a few of my travel-savvy friends and coworkers.

The name Travel-Go-Budget is a rough adaptation of "happy-go-lucky" and I think it fits nicely with a web app that randomly generates a travel destination for the user.

This website was built using React.
