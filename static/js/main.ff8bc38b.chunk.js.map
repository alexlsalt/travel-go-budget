Plus, Lyon has these rad hidden passageways that you can freely access by going through normal apartment or store buildings!\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    title: \"Instead of the Maldives, consider Zanzibar, Tanzania.\",\r\n    description: \"Beautiful beaches, turquoise waters and excellent hotels for a fraction of the price. Bonus, the seafood is incredible & if you fancy more than just relaxing, plenty of safaris start from Dar es Salaam, just a couple of hours boat ride away.\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    title: \"Instead of Prague, consider Krakow.\",\r\n    description: \"While Prague us still considered far more budget friendly than the usual big European cities, if you're on a tight budget think about skipping on Prague for Krakow. Beers, food, accommodations and activities all come in at a much more affordable price. Krakow offers rich history and architecture (it was spared in WWII), more local culture  (Prague has become super touristy in the last decade or so), fewer tourists during high seasons and their old town is equally as picturesque with the main square (Rynek Glowny) being one of the largest medieval town squares in Europe.\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    title: \"Instead of Prague, consider Tallinn, Estonia.\",\r\n    description: \"Tallinn’s old town is one of the best preserved medieval cities in Europe. Super beautiful architecture on every street. Significantly less touristy than the likes of Prague, Krakow or Budapest and the price matches. Even staying in the old town itself, in buildings from the Middle Ages, is super affordable & if you want to get out or visit two cities during your trip, Helsinki is only a two hour ferry away.\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    title: \"Instead of Singapore, consider Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.\",\r\n    description: \"A little more on the wild side than super organised Singapore, Ho Chi Minh City is filled with awesome historic sites, temples & even better food. It’s a perfect city to sit in a sky bar atop a skyscraper with a fancy cocktail but unlike in Singapore, it won’t break the bank.\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    title: \"Instead of Napa Valley, California - consider Mendoza, Argentina.\",\r\n    description: \"Mendoza looks a little different than Napa (it's a lot hotter and drier, and the towering Andes mountains that loom over the valley dwarf Napa's hillsides) but it offers the same focus on luxury and relaxation. There are fantastic resorts tucked into vineyards, high-end spas, award-winning wineries and restaurants—all at a fraction of the price you'd spend in Napa. Plus, there's the Andes, where you can hike ski, horseback ride, kayak, soak in hot springs, or go white water rafting.\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    title: \"Instead of Dublin, consider Galway, Ireland.\",\r\n    description: \"Dublin may be the first city that comes to mind when thinking of Ireland, but the capital is busy and expensive, and many Irish people will say that the most 'Irish' city in Ireland is Galway. It's where the claddagh ring originated and its home to the highest concentration of Irish speakers in Ireland.\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    title: \"Instead of the Seychelles, consider Lamu, Kenya.\",\r\n    description: \"Lamu is one of Africa’s oft-forgotten beach destinations that’s absolutely gorgeous with pristine white beaches and world-class resorts, yet it also provides affordable options for the budget traveler. It’s easily accessible via its airport, and it’s got excellent access to the internet. It’s also full of adventure and culture including the annual Lamu Festival that includes an exciting donkey race, and a dhow race that brings together different groups from across the island. There’s also a cool museum that traces the history of the Swahili people (plus it’s a World Heritage site).\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    title: \"Instead of Hawaii, consider Phu Quoc, Vietnam.\",\r\n    description: \"Just south of Cambodia, Phu Quoc is a Vietnamese island that is quickly growing in popularity. Like Hawaii, Phu Quoc has great national parks, solid areas for snorkeling and stunning beaches. Unlike Hawaii, it has historic Buddhist temples, cheap all-inclusive resorts and some pretty damn good Vietnamese food. It’s also *way* cheaper. Reportedly on its way to being the next Bali, get there before hordes of tourists take over.\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    title: \"Instead of Iceland, consider the Shetland Islands.\",\r\n    description: \"These subarctic Scottish islands lie closer to Norway than the UK and are a far cry from tourist filled Iceland. Far enough north to spot the Northern Lights on clear nights & filled with historic sites, rugged natural beauty and lots of whisky. These islands also play host to Up Helly Aa, a Viking inspired fire festival which takes place every January. Not to be missed.\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    title: \"Instead of the Bernese Alps in Switzerland, consider the Austrian Alps.\",\r\n    description: \"It isn’t hard to be cheaper than Switzerland, however, it’s also hard to match Switzerland for sheer natural beauty. Luckily, Austria manages to do just that in a number of locations. Hallstat is a beautifully scenic village with historic buildings, mountains and lakes. For snow sports, Molltaller Gletscher has beautiful glaciers and is in the sunniest part of Austria and for unbeatable mountain and lake filled landscapes head to Vorderer Gasousee to see its three lakes surrounded by Dachstein mountains. These locations might not be super cheap but they’re certainly waaaay cheaper than anywhere in Switzerland.\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    title: \"Instead of Barcelona, consider Coimbra, Portugal.\",\r\n    description: \"The medieval capital of Portugal is often overshadowed by colorful Lisbon, Algarve beaches , Porto’s wineries and better known Spanish cities but it truly is a beautiful city with winding streets and historic churches dotted all over. Coimbra is also home to Portugal’s oldest university (founded 1290) and it’s student vibe makes it a great place to chill out, listen to some fado and drink excellent wine, all for far cheaper than you’d find in other Portuguese & Spanish cities.\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    title: \"Instead of Bali, consider Riau Archipelago, Indonesia.\",\r\n    description: \"Clean beaches, sandy islands and over-water bungalows are just a quick ferry ride away from Singapore--no expensive transfers needed. Comprising hundreds of islands, the Riau Archipelago is studded with accommodations ranging from private islands with all-inclusive resorts to inexpensive hostels in traditional fishing villages.\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    title: \"Instead of Taipei, consider Tainan, Taiwan.\",\r\n    description: \"Chill night markets, neighborhood temples and sprawling fortresses without the crowds and big city prices. Less than two hours from the capital by bullet train, Tainan is an affordable window into Taiwan's political and religious history. Better still, expect sunny skies while Taipei is raining buckets.\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    title: \"Instead of Seoul, consider Busan, South Korea.\",\r\n    description: \"Big city vibe, small town prices. Expect the same all-night neon vibe as Seoul, but your Korean BBQ, fresh seafood and shaved ice are going to be a fraction of the cost, plus the city hosts major cultural events such as the Busan Film Festival. Busan is also a hub for budget airline flights to Japan, Southeast Asia or even Mongolia if you're looking to travel further afield.\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    title: \"Instead of Tuscany, consider Abruzzo, Italy.\",\r\n    description: \"One of the last slivers of one of the most popular tourist countries in the world where one can still show up to a town and be the only foreigner for miles. There are charming, beautiful hill towns (two favorites are Prezza and Pacentro, both easy to access from the 'hub' of Sulmona), delicious restaurants and agriturismi, and some absolutely stunning spots to hike. All for ridiculously low prices. The national parks are incredible (and free) with trails winding high in the mountains through forests and fields of wildflowers, where you're much more likely to bump into a shepherd with his flock than another tourist.\"\r\n  }\r\n];\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default ideas;\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\nimport './TextBox.css';\r\nimport ideas from '../../TravelTip.js';\r\n\r\n\r\nclass TextBox extends React.Component {\r\n  displayTravelIdea() {\r\n    const { index } = this.props;\r\n    return ideas[index];\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    const idea = this.displayTravelIdea();\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n      <div className=\"textbox\">\r\n        <div className=\"compare\">\r\n          <h3>{idea.title}</h3>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className=\"description\">\r\n          <p>{idea.description}</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default TextBox;\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\nimport './Button.css';\r\n\r\nclass Button extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <button onClick={this.props.onClick}>\r\n        {this.props.label}\r\n      </button>\r\n  )}\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Button;\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\nimport './App.css';\r\nimport Header from '../Header/Header';\r\nimport TextBox from '../TextBox/TextBox';\r\nimport Button from '../Button/Button';\r\nimport ideas from '../../TravelTip.js';\r\n\r\n\r\nclass App extends React.Component {\r\n  constructor(props) {\r\n    super(props);\r\n    this.state = { index: 0 };\r\n    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  handleClick() {\r\n    const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * ideas.length);\r\n    this.setState({ index: randomIndex });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div className=\"App\">\r\n        <Header />\r\n        <TextBox index={ this.state.index }/>\r\n        <div className=\"button-wrap\">\r\n          <Button label=\"Get a new travel tip\" onClick={this.handleClick}/>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className=\"footer\">\r\n          <span>Travel Go Budget developed by <a href=\"http://alexlsalt.github.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alex Morton</a></span>\r\n          <span>View project on <a href=\"https://github.com/alexlsalt/travel-go-budget/tree/master\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub</a></span>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default App;\r\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\r\n// register() is not called by default.\r\n\r\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\r\n// it offline capabilities.
